# An Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in the cluster, 
# in this case, via TLS(HTTPS).
# 
# It should be noted that while we are only supporting TLS for access to the Ingress, the TLS
# termination is handled by a load-balancer in front of the actual Ingress service.  As such, 
# the rules must all be under /spec/rules/n/http and not /spec/rules/n/https
#
# Furthermore, the path must start with the namespace name - and since the namespace name
# varies by environment, it will need to be patched in the overlays, and therefore a
# placeholder is included here
